This was the result of a project given in a game A.I. course I took in college. This project took over 3 months to complete
and progress is still being made to refine it. It uses A* pathfinding, image analysis, and real-time event handling to give
the illusion of a human player playing a large scale MMO game, World Of Tanks.
